# Building a C/C++/Obj-C project

There's 2 ways we can build our C/C++/Obj-C project using Beaver;

1. We can manually compose our build commands using Beaver's commands (similar to makefile):
   [1.1 Using commands](./1t-1-1-using-commands-to-build-a-c-project.md)
2. We can also use Beaver's projects to define libraries and executables, this is the easiest solution:
   [1.2 Using a project](./1t-1-2-using-project-to-build-a-c-project.md)
