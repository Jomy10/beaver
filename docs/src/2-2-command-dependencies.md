# Command dependencies

We can specify when to re-run a command depending on if the input files have changed,
or the output file is not present.

## Input file dependencies

### [each](./2-2-1-each.md)

Re-runs the command for the files that have changed.

### [all](./2-2-2-all.md)

Re-runs the command when any of the input files have changed.
