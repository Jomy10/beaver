# Beaver

Capable build system and command runner for any project.

Projects can be built programmatically because configuration is written in Ruby.

It is an excellent replacement for make and cmake.

## Example

```ruby
Project(name: "Game")

C::Library(
  name: "Physics",
  description: "Physics simulation library",
  language: :cpp,
  sources: "lib/physics/*.cpp",
  include: "include/physics"
)

C::Library(
  name: "Renderer",
  language: :c,
  sources: "lib/renderer/*.c",
  include: "include/renderer",
  dependencies: [
    pkgconfig("SDL2"),
    system("pthread")
  ]
)

C::Executable(
  name: "Game",
  language: :cpp,
  sources: "src/*.cpp",
  dependencies: ["Physics", "Renderer"]
)
```

## Building

Building requires **ruby** to be installed. The ruby version linked to will be the one that is accessible
from the command line `ruby --version`.

```sh
cargo build -p beaver-cli
```
